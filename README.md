# ANTLR4 Playground

This is my personal repository for experimenting with [ANTLR4](https://www.antlr.org/), a powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files.

## 🚀 About

This repository contains grammar files (`*.g4`), example source files, and Java-based parser code for learning and testing ANTLR4. It's intended as a sandbox for building domain-specific languages (DSLs), exploring grammar design, and integrating parsing into Java projects.

## 🔧 Requirements

- Java 11+ (Java 17 or 21 recommended)
- [ANTLR4 Tool](https://www.antlr.org/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 
- ANTLR4 Java runtime: `org.antlr:antlr4-runtime`

## 📚 Learning Resources

- [ANTLR4 Book: The Definitive Guide](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpantlr2/the-definitive-antlr-4-reference/)
- [ANTLR Mega Tutorial (GitHub)](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4)

## 🧠 Goals

- ✅ Practice grammar design
- ✅ Build and test custom parsers
- ✅ Explore DSL design
- ✅ Integrate parsing logic in Java
